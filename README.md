# BlogIt
![alt BlogIt](https://github.com/tobymac208/BlogIt/blob/main/src/images/BlogIt%20example.png?raw=true)

Showcase project for: <br />
    - Portfolio projects. <br />
    - Blog posts. These are all in regards to my journey as a developer, what helped me along the way, and other things I (and others) deem as "important enough" to post. Promises I may have to whether it's quality or not? No :( But I hope you do enjoy what's here! <br />

## About
I've been meaning to create this for a while. I just needed to find a contemporary stack to build the project with. <br />
I first started with a Django/React app. However, Node.js is even simpler to use than Django, I think. Furthermore, I only need to nail down JavaScript skills with the MERN stack I aim to build this project with. <br />
